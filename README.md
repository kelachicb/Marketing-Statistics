## Goal of this Project

This project aims to compare two separate advertisement campaigns, the Facebook Ad Campaign and the AdWords Campaign, to determine which is more effective in generating more conversions. To understand this, we analyzed the relationship between a campaign's number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions. We determined
  1. The measures of central tendency
  2. Some measures of dispersion, and
  3. The frequency and correlation data for a campaign's clicks and conversions

A Histogram was created from data samples to determine the shape that best describes the data distribution. The distribution shows the probability of possible outcomes occurring within the dataset.

## Technologies Utilized
* Google Sheets
* Excel
* Tableau

## Data Loading
The provided data was efficiently loaded into Tableau, facilitating the execution of a straightforward linear regression analysis model.

## Analysis and Insights
Compelling insights emerged after analyzing the performance of the Facebook and AdWords Ad Campaigns. The Facebook platform demonstrated a significantly superior Return on Investment (ROI) for marketing endeavours. The analysis revealed a 96.34% increase in conversion rates on the Facebook platform, accompanied by a cost reduction of $17,226 compared to the AdWords platform.

## Recommendation
Based on our findings, it is recommended to strategically allocate a more significant portion of the marketing budget to the Facebook platform. This adjustment is anticipated to achieve increased success and optimize the overall marketing strategy.
