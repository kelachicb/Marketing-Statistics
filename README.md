## Goal of this Project

##### The purpose of this project is to compare two separate advertisement campaigns, the Facebook Ad Campaign and the AdWords Campaign, to determine which is more effective in generating more conversions. To understand this, we analyzed the relationship between a campaign's number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions. We determined
  1. The measures of central tendency
  2. Some measures of dispersion, and
  3. The frequency and correlation data for a campaign's clicks and conversions
