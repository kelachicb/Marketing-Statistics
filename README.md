## Goal of this Project

The purpose of this project is to compare two separate advertisement campaigns, the Facebook Ad Campaign and the AdWords Campaign, to determine which is more effective in generating more conversions. To understand this, we analyzed the relationship between a campaign's number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions. We determined
  1. The measures of central tendency
  2. Some measures of dispersion, and
  3. The frequency and correlation data for a campaign's clicks and conversions

A Histogram was created from data samples to determine the shape that best describes the distribution of data. The distribution shows the probability of possible outcomes occurring within the dataset.

## Technologies Used
* Google Sheets
* Excel
* Tableau

## Data Loading
The data provided was loaded into Tableau, which was used to run a simple Linear regression analysis model.

## Analysis and Insights
From the analysis performed on the data comparing the performance of the Facebook Ad Campaign and Adwords Ad campaign, we can see the Facebook platform generated better ROI for the marketing efforts. We discovered a 96.34% increase in the number of conversions for the marketing efforts on the Facebook platform while also spending $17,226 less than the marketing efforts on the Adwords platform.

The key takeaway from this analysis is that we will see more success when we focus our marketing efforts on our Facebook platform. My recommendation to you is to allocate more of the marketing budget to the Facebook platform.
